## Introduction

The past few years have witnessed the development of many sophisticated statistical methods that combine geometric morphometrics with phylogenetic comparative methods. In addition, recently developed R packages have made these methods readily accessible to evolutionary biologists. These methods allow researchers to test numerous macroevolutionary hypotheses that cannot be addressed with traditional geometric morphometrics or univarite phylogenetic comparative methods. 

This document summarizes the analyses and results I've obtained from applying phylogenetic geometric morphometric methods (PGMMs) to a comparative dataset on primate cranial shape from Fleagle et al. (2010). By analyzing this data in a phylogenetic context, I hope to yield insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors underlying variation in primate cranial shape. This investigation is divided into three chapters:

1. Effects of allometry and sexual dimorphism on primate cranial shape
2. Ecomorphology of primate cranial shape
3. Modularity, integration, and rates of primate cranial shape evolution

The same landmark data and phylogeny are used in all three chapters. The primate cranial shape dataset includes 18 landmarks for a male and female specimen from a representative species of each primate genus. The phylogeny is a consensus tree from 10kTrees (Arnold et al. 2010). The only changes I made to the data involved editing taxa labels so that they match between the data and the phylogeny, and I dropped two taxa from the landmark data because they were not present in the phylogeny. Landmarks were aligned using generalized procrustes alignment prior to all analyses, and centroid sizes were recorded for all crania. 

## CHAPTER 1: Effects of allometry and sexual dimorphism on primate cranial shape



## CHAPTER 2: Ecomorphology of primate cranial shape



## CHAPTER 3: Modularity, integration, and rates of primate cranial shape evolution

Modularity and integration are closely related concepts that describe patterns of covariation among anatomical structures within organisms. Modular structures are relatively independent of one another, while integrated structures tend to covary. Modularity and integration can be observed at multiple levels: across ontogenetic stages within an individual, across individuals within a population or species, and across species within a higher taxonomic group. In addition, multiple biological processes contribute to patterns of integration at each level of variation, including genetic pleiotropy, linkage disequilibrium, allometry, physical interactions among structures during development, and environmental factors that simultaneously influence the development or evolution of multiple structures. Detecting patterns of modularity and integration and the processes that give rise to them requires different study designs depending on the level of variation and the biological process under investigation.

The vast majority of research on cranial modularity and integration has focused on variation within populations or species (Klingenberg 2013). However, modularity and integration can also be studied on a macroevolutionary scale (Klingenberg & Marugán-Lobón 2013). At this scale, patterns of modularity and integration are influenced by a combination of genetic, developmental, functional, and evolutionary factors. Previous studies have found that overall patterns of cranial modularity are remarkably consistent across primates (bunch of studies, cited in Ackerman 2009) and even across mammals (Goswami 2006; Marroig et al., 2009; Porto et al., 2009). This stability is likely due in part to genetic and developmental constraints, and in part due to stabilizing selection. On the other hand, while *patterns* of modularity are largely stable across taxa, the *magnitude* of integration across modules can vary considerably (e.g., Claverie & Patek, 2013), and it has been hypothesized that variation in the strength of integration can influence morphological evolution on a macroevolutionary scale (Olson & Miller, 1958). For instance, it has been hypothesized that modularity will tend to increase through evolutionary time as natural selection favors the relaxation of constraints that integration places on morphological diversification (Marcot & McShea, 2007; Porto et al., 2009). Another hypothesis is that greater modularity facilitates higher rates of evolutionary change, because different modules can respond independently to different selection pressures, while greater integration results in slower evolutionary rates (Goswami & Polly, 2010; Claverie & Patek, 2013; Goswami et al., 2015). 




## Conclusions

This project demonstrates the broad scope of macroevolutionary questions that can be addressed when geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods are integrated.
