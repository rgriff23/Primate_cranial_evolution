# Primate cranial shape evolution: Combining geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods

[Randi H. Griffin]()

This repository contains the R code for my ongoing dissertation work.

___

### Data
The data come from a study published in 2010 by J.G. Fleagle, C.C. Gilbert, and A.L. Baden (Fleagle et al., 2010). 

Hopefully I will get permission to add the data soon.

### Code
`PrimateSkulls.R` contains the code to run the analyses. Unfortunately, the code is useless without the data.

### Results

`Synopsis.md` contains an overview of my analyses and results so far. 

The folder **figures** contains the figures that are included in `Synopsis.md`.
